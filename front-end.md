## 1- SSG (Static Site Generation):
 is a modern web development approach where HTML pages are pre-built at compile time (during the build process) rather than being generated on-demand for each request.

### Key Features:

    - Pages are rendered ahead of time (during deployment)

    - No need for server-side processing (unlike traditional SSR)

    - Output consists of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
### Advantages:

    Blazing Fast Performance – Pages are pre-rendered and served instantly

    High Security – No database or server-side vulnerabilities

    Easy Scalability – Can handle high traffic with minimal server requirements

    SEO-Friendly – Fully rendered HTML is ready for search engine indexing

    Cost-Effective – Can be hosted on CDNs or static hosting services (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)
### Limitations:

    Requires a rebuild to update content (not ideal for highly dynamic sites)

    Not suitable for real-time data without client-side JavaScript
### popular framework: Next.js , Nuxt.js
